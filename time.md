Prior to this task I only had 2.5 hours experience with Symfony console from a different small task about a week ago so I utilised my existing Laravel knowlege where I could.

For this project I had to find out how to use a model which took me about 30 mins due to using 'use \AppBundle\Models\Checker' instead of simply 'use App\Checker'.

Once I had a working command to use a model with, this is my time breakdown for each function:
- Around 10 minutes for the palindrome task, most of this was testing.
- Around 20 minutes for the anagram task. I originally started writing my own function until I realised PHP likely had something already and thus found the 'count_chars' function.
- Around 15 minutes for the pangram task. From the previous task, I started looking at existing functions so then it was just the logic to do.

Just over an hour roughly was spent in total.
